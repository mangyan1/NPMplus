# Changelog

All notable changes to the NPMplus Security Fork are documented here. The fork uses release identifiers based on the bundled NPMplus version followed by a fork-specific sequence.

## Unreleased

- Clarified the README and operations guide so the version-pinned release-candidate installer is shown before the rolling `develop` channel.

## v2.15.1-mangyan1.rc.1 - 2026-09-04

First public release candidate of the security-focused fork.

### Added

- One-command interactive installation and maintenance for Debian and Ubuntu.
- Transactional updates with health checks, rollback snapshots, daily backups, reboot diagnostics, and CrowdSec credential repair.
- CrowdSec AppSec, firewall-bouncer, Anubis, and honeypot integrations with dashboard monitoring.
- A compact security dashboard with local alerts, local bans, attack geography, engine health, AppSec metrics, and protected manual actions.
- Fork-owned multi-architecture release images, SBOM/provenance attestations, exact-image vulnerability gates, and checksum-protected installer assets.

### Security

- Loopback-only administration and security-service listeners by default.
- Temporary administrator bootstrap secrets instead of credentials stored in Compose.
- Digest-pinned deployment images and reviewed, expiring vulnerability exceptions for unmodified upstream components.
- Hardened session, browser, API, container, and host-maintenance defaults.

### Changed

- Documentation and project website are focused on a simple reverse-proxy and security appliance workflow.
- PHP-FPM deployment is intentionally left to the proxied application stacks.
